[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/unifio/terraform-aws-asg/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/unifio/terraform-aws-asg/tree/master)

Module stack supporting multiple deployment scenarios of an Auto Scaling Group to an AWS VPC.

## Prerequisites ##

- Pre-configured AWS VPC

## Requirements ##

- Terraform 0.6.15 or newer
- AWS provider

## Basic Group Module ##

The `basic` group module sets up an auto scaling group for simple automated failover within a VPC.

### Input Variables ###

- `stack_item_label` - Short form identifier for this stack. This value is used to create the "Name" resource tag for resources created by this stack item, and also serves as a unique key for re-use.
- `stack_item_fullname` - Long form descriptive name for this stack item. This value is used to create the "application" resource tag for resources created by this stack item.
- `vpc_id` - ID of the target VPC.
- `region` - EC2 region to be utilized.
- `subnets` - List of VPC subnets to be utilized.
- `ami` - AMI to associate with the launch configuration.
- `instance_type` - EC2 instance type to associate with the launch configuration.
- `instance_profile` - IAM instance profile to associate with the launch configuration.
- `key_name` - SSH key pair to associate with the launch configuration.
- `associate_public_ip_address` - Associate a public ip address with an instance in a VPC.
- `user_data` - User data to associate with the launch configuration.
- `enable_monitoring` - Flag to enable detailed monitoring. Defaults to 'true'.
- `ebs_optimized` - Flag to enable EBS optimization. Defaults to 'true'.
- `placement_tenancy` - The tenancy of the instance. Valid values are "default" or "dedicated".
- `max_size` - Maximum number of instances allowed by the auto scaling group.
- `min_size` - Minimum number of instance to be maintained by the auto scaling group.
- `hc_grace_period` - Time allowed after an instance comes into service before checking health.
- `hc_check_type` - Type of health check performed by the auto scaling group. Choice of 'ELB' or 'EC2'.
- `force_delete` - Flag to allow deletion of the auto scaling group without waiting for all instances in the pool to terminate. Defaults to 'false'.
- `wait_for_capacity_timeout` - (Default: "10m") A maximum duration that Terraform should wait for ASG instances to be healthy before timing out.
